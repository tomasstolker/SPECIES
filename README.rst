*species* is a toolkit for atmospheric characterization of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. It provides a coherent framework for spectral and photometric analysis which builds on publicly-available data from various resources such as spectral and photometric libraries, atmospheric models, and evolutionary tracks. There are tools available for grid retrievals with Bayesian inference, color-magnitude diagrams, spectral and photometric calibration, synthetic photometry, and more. The package has been released on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/species/>`_ and is actively developed and maintained on Github.
